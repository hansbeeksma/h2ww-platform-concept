## 🎓 Learning Journey Framework (v2.0)

### **TRUST Methodology**
Building on our design system foundation, H2WW now includes a comprehensive learning framework:

- **T**ransparantie - Understanding AI decision-making
- **R**eliability - Assessing AI capabilities and limitations
- **U**tility - Identifying practical applications
- **S**afety - Developing risk awareness
- **T**ransformatie - Integrating AI into workflows

### **21-Week Progressive Curriculum**
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-6):** Foundation & anxiety reduction
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 7-15):** Skill building & confidence development
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 16-21):** Real-world application & mastery

### **Target Audience Evolution**
- **Primary:** AI-conservative users (anxiety-first approach)
- **Secondary:** AI-novice users (structured skill development)

### **Community-Centric Learning**
- Peer learning circles (max 8 people)
- Mentor matching program
- Alumni network support

### **Research Foundation**
Based on evidence from three major sources:
1. Pedagogical agent design research
2. Agentic AI frameworks
3. Intelligent automation methodologies

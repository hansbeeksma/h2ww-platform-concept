# Figma Plugin Update Workflow

Please help me update the H2WW Figma plugin to reflect recent design system changes or add new component generation capabilities.

## Update Requirements
- **Change Type**: [New Component | Token Update | Bug Fix | Feature Enhancement | Performance Optimization]
- **Target Components**: [Specify which components need updating or adding]
- **Plugin Sections Affected**: [Which of the 9 tabs/categories need changes]

## Component Factory Updates

### New Component Addition
- Add component to appropriate category (Visual Language, UI Elements, etc.)
- Implement component generation logic
- Apply correct design tokens automatically
- Ensure consistency with React implementation
- Test component creation and customization

### Token System Updates
- Update design token definitions in plugin
- Ensure token application remains automatic
- Test token changes across all existing components
- Validate color, spacing, typography token accuracy

### Architecture Improvements
- Optimize component factory performance
- Improve error handling and user feedback
- Enhance plugin UI and user experience
- Add new automation capabilities

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test component generation for all affected components
- [ ] Verify design token application accuracy
- [ ] Test plugin performance with large component libraries
- [ ] Validate generated components match React implementation
- [ ] Test plugin UI across different screen sizes
- [ ] Verify error handling and edge cases

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update plugin documentation in docs/ folder
- [ ] Create or update usage examples
- [ ] Document any new features or changes
- [ ] Update component library references

### Design System Alignment
- [ ] Generated components match latest design system version
- [ ] All 9 component categories properly supported
- [ ] Bauhaus principles reflected in generated components
- [ ] Itten color theory correctly applied

## Technical Implementation

### Code Quality
- Maintain TypeScript type safety
- Follow existing plugin architecture patterns
- Optimize for performance and memory usage
- Implement proper error handling

### User Experience
- Maintain intuitive plugin interface
- Provide clear feedback during component generation
- Support both individual and batch component creation
- Ensure accessibility of plugin UI itself

## Deployment
1. Test plugin locally with design system components
2. Validate against React implementations
3. Update plugin version and changelog
4. Test in Figma environment
5. Update documentation and examples

Please analyze the current plugin implementation, identify the changes needed, and implement the updates following these standards.

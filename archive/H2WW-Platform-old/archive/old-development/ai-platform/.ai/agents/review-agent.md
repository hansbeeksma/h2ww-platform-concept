- [ ] Brand colors maintain consistency with guidelines

**Typography Consistency**
- [ ] Heading hierarchy follows logical progression (H1‚ÜíH6)
- [ ] Body text maintains readable line-height (1.4-1.6)
- [ ] Font weights used purposefully and consistently
- [ ] Text sizing scales appropriately across devices

**Spacing & Layout**
- [ ] Consistent spacing tokens used throughout
- [ ] Grid alignment maintained across all screens
- [ ] Component padding/margins follow system rules
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints handle content gracefully

## Executive Summary

The H2WW Platform requires specialized HCI design to address the unique cognitive and emotional challenges of AI-anxious learners. This specification outlines evidence-based interaction patterns that build trust, reduce cognitive load, and support progressive skill development while maintaining human agency and control.

**Key Design Philosophy:**
- **Anxiety-First Design**: Every interaction pattern considers emotional state
- **Trust Through Transparency**: AI behavior is always explainable and controllable
- **Progressive Empowerment**: Learners gain agency gradually through positive experiences
- **Community-Mediated Learning**: Social proof reduces individual anxiety
- **Fail-Safe Interactions**: Mistakes become learning opportunities, not sources of anxiety

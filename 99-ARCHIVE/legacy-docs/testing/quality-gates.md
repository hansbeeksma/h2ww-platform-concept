# H2WW Component Library Quality Gates

## Overview

Quality gates are automated checkpoints that ensure the H2WW Component Library maintains high standards for anxiety-aware design, accessibility, and technical excellence. All contributions must pass these gates before being merged or deployed.

## Quality Gate Definitions

- Warnings must be addressed or justified

#### Automated Checks
- Pre-commit hooks validate JSON syntax and schema compliance
- CI pipeline runs comprehensive schema validation
- Schema violations block pull request merging

- Keyboard navigation support for all functionality
- Screen reader compatibility
- Touch target sizes ≥ 44px

#### Automated Tests
- Color contrast validation
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader markup validation
- Touch target size verification

### 5. Performance Gate

**Threshold**: Performance benchmarks met
**Severity**: Warning → Blocking based on severity

#### Criteria
- JSON validation: ≤ 50ms per component
- Large file processing: ≤ 10 seconds for 1000 components
- Memory usage: ≤ 100MB peak for standard operations
- Figma plugin load time: ≤ 3 seconds

#### Performance Benchmarks
```
Component Processing:
├── Small library (≤50 components): <500ms
├── Medium library (≤200 components): <2s
├── Large library (≤1000 components): <10s
└── Enterprise library (>1000 components): <30s

Memory Usage:
├── Base operations: <50MB
├── Large file processing: <100MB
├── Concurrent validation: <150MB
└── Memory leaks: 0 detected
```

### 6. Visual Regression Gate

**Threshold**: No unintended visual changes
**Severity**: Blocking for UI changes

#### Criteria
- Visual regression tests pass for all supported browsers
- Component screenshots match approved baselines
- Cross-platform rendering consistency
- No accessibility visual regressions

#### Browser Support Matrix
- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest 2 versions)

### 7. Security Gate

**Threshold**: No high/critical security vulnerabilities
**Severity**: Blocking

#### Criteria
- No secrets in JSON files
- Dependency vulnerability scan passes
- Code injection prevention validated
- API key and token protection verified

## Quality Metrics Dashboard

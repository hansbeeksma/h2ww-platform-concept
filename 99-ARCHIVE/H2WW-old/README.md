## üìö Core Concept
H2WW uses the **TRUST Framework**:
- **T**ransparantie - Understanding AI decision-making
- **R**eliability - Assessing AI capabilities and limitations
- **U**tility - Identifying practical applications
- **S**afety - Developing risk awareness
- **T**ransformatie - Integrating AI into workflows

## üöÄ Current Status: Concept v2.0 Complete
- ‚úÖ Research analysis completed (3 major sources)
- ‚úÖ Concept v2.0 finalized with TRUST framework
- ‚úÖ 21-week progressive curriculum designed
- ‚úÖ Implementation roadmap defined
- üöß Next: MVP development planning
- üìù Business strategy in draft phase

## üìã Key Research Integration
Our concept integrates insights from three major research sources:

### 1. Pedagogical Agent Design Research
- Human-centered AI adoption principles
- Trust-building through social transparency
- Incremental information collection strategies
- Peer validation and community support

### 2. Agentic AI Framework
- Five levels of AI autonomy (basic automation to AGI)
- Progressive learning from suggestion-mode to autonomous collaboration
- Human-AI collaboration skill development
- 12-stage mastery framework for structured learning

### 3. Intelligent Automation Insights
- IRREPLACEABLE competency model (AI-Ready, Human-Ready, Change-Ready)
- Four-phase progressive implementation methodology
- Augmentation philosophy: enhancing rather than replacing humans
- Trust as the "new currency" in AI adoption

## üéØ Target Audience
- **Primary:** AI-conservative users (low AI literacy + negative attitude)
- **Secondary:** AI-novice users (low AI literacy + neutral/positive attitude)

## üìà Success Metrics
- 80% participants reach "AI-confidence" level within 6 months
- NPS score > 70
- Completion rate > 60%
- Active community engagement > 40%

## üîÑ 21-Week Learning Journey

### Phase 1: Verkenning (Week 1-6)
- AI-angst assessment and addressing
- Basic AI literacy development
- First "safe" AI interactions
- Community introduction and peer support

### Phase 2: Ontwikkeling (Week 7-15)
- Four core IA capabilities (Vision, Language, Execution, Thinking)
- Transition from task-thinking to workflow-thinking
- Delegation and oversight skills development
- Hands-on projects in sandbox environments

### Phase 3: Integratie (Week 16-21)
- Real-world implementation projects
- Multi-agent system understanding
- Ethical AI framework development
- Personal AI strategy creation

## ü§ù Community-Centric Approach
- Peer learning circles (max 8 people per group)
- Mentor matching and guidance programs
- Success story sharing and celebration
- Alumni network for ongoing support
- Safe experimentation environments

## üî¨ Evidence-Based Methodology
- Grounded in academic research and proven frameworks
- Progressive trust-building through incremental exposure
- Social learning and peer validation mechanisms
- Measurable outcomes and continuous improvement
- Ethical AI principles embedded throughout

## üé≠ Unique Value Propositions
1. **Anxiety-First Approach:** Only platform specifically designed for AI-anxious users
2. **Evidence-Based:** Research-backed methodologies from leading institutions
3. **Community-Driven:** Strong peer support and collaborative learning
4. **Progressive Learning:** Gradual confidence building vs overwhelming information
5. **Practical Focus:** Real-world application over theoretical knowledge
6. **Dutch Market Specialization:** Localized content and cultural understanding

# Samswaab Platform Rules

## Project Context
Modern AI-driven platform for rapid prototyping.
NO legacy agent-orchestration code.

## File Structure
- Pipeline logic: src/pipeline/
- AI configs: .ai/
- Projects: projects/active/
- Components: components/

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode
- Functional components
- Tailwind CSS
- No class components

## Workflow
1. Concepts go in concepts/active/
2. Pipeline processes them
3. Output goes to projects/

## Important
NEVER use or reference agent-orchestration folder
Always use the new pipeline structure

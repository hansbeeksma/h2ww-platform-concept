# Accessibility Review Workflow

Please conduct a comprehensive accessibility review of the specified component, feature, or section using H2WW accessibility standards.

## Review Scope
- **Target**: [Specify component, page, or feature to review]
- **User Scenarios**: Test with all three personas (Learning Explorers, Skill Builders, Innovation Drivers)
- **Assistive Technology**: Consider screen readers, keyboard navigation, voice control

## WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Checklist

### Perceivable
- [ ] Color contrast ratios meet minimum standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- [ ] Content works without color alone conveying information
- [ ] Images have appropriate alt text
- [ ] Audio/video content has alternatives (captions, transcripts)
- [ ] Content is adaptable to different presentations

### Operable
- [ ] All functionality available via keyboard
- [ ] No content causes seizures or physical reactions
- [ ] Users have enough time to read and use content
- [ ] Focus indicators are clearly visible
- [ ] Navigation is consistent and predictable

### Understandable
- [ ] Text is readable and understandable
- [ ] Content appears and operates in predictable ways
- [ ] Error identification and correction assistance provided
- [ ] Labels and instructions are clear and helpful

### Robust
- [ ] Content works with assistive technologies
- [ ] HTML is valid and semantic
- [ ] ARIA labels used appropriately
- [ ] Compatibility tested across different browsers/devices

## H2WW-Specific Considerations

### AI Learning Context
- [ ] AI assistance features are accessible to all users
- [ ] Complex AI interactions have simple alternatives
- [ ] Learning progression accommodates different abilities
- [ ] Error messages support learning rather than frustration

### User Persona Accessibility
- [ ] **Learning Explorers**: Extra guidance and safety features accessible
- [ ] **Skill Builders**: Practice features work with assistive technology
- [ ] **Innovation Drivers**: Advanced features remain accessible

### Design System Integration
- [ ] Design tokens support accessibility (color, spacing, typography)
- [ ] Components maintain accessibility when customized
- [ ] Accessibility features are documented and reusable

## Testing Method
1. Automated accessibility testing (if tools available)
2. Manual keyboard navigation testing
3. Screen reader testing (if possible)
4. Color vision simulation
5. Text scaling testing (up to 200%)
6. Documentation of findings and recommendations

Please provide detailed findings, prioritized recommendations, and implementation guidance for any accessibility improvements needed.

# New Component Creation Workflow

Please help me create a new design system component with the following specifications:

## Component Requirements

- **Accessibility Level**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

## Design System Integration

- Ensure consistency with existing 200+ components

## Technical Implementation

- Include proper accessibility features (ARIA, focus management)
- Apply design tokens for colors, spacing, typography
- Include responsive design considerations
- Write clear component documentation

## Research Considerations
- Reference Human-AI interaction principles if relevant
- Consider learning context and educational workflows
- Apply appropriate progressive complexity
- Ensure component supports AI assistance patterns

## Deliverables Needed
1. React component implementation
2. Design token integration
3. Accessibility testing checklist
4. Component documentation
5. Usage examples for all three user personas
6. Integration with existing design system

Please analyze existing components first, then create the new component following these standards.

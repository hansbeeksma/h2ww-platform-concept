## üéØ Context Adaptation Patterns

### **Project Profile Extensions**
```yaml
project_profiles:
  ai_learning_platform: # Existing H2WW profile
    required_agents: [ai-learning-specialist, design-system-specialist, accessibility-expert]
    recommended_agents: [user-researcher, content-specialist, ml-engineer]

  enterprise_saas: # New profile
    required_agents: [security-specialist, compliance-specialist, api-specialist, devops-specialist]
    recommended_agents: [support-specialist, privacy-specialist, incident-specialist]

  consumer_mobile_app: # New profile
    required_agents: [ux-optimizer, performance-optimizer, user-researcher]
    recommended_agents: [growth-specialist, onboarding-specialist, analytics-specialist]

  design_system_platform: # New profile
    required_agents: [design-system-specialist, frontend-specialist, accessibility-expert]
    recommended_agents: [visual-designer, figma-plugin-specialist, documentation]
```

### **Dynamic Context Switching**
```yaml
context_switching:
  project_evolution:
    mvp_to_scale:
      remove: [prototyping-focused-agents]
      add: [devops-specialist, performance-optimizer, support-specialist]

    b2b_to_b2c_pivot:
      reconfigure:
        marketing-specialist: {focus: "consumer_marketing"}
        user-researcher: {focus: "consumer_behavior"}
        compliance-specialist: {focus: "consumer_privacy"}
```

## üìä Architecture Performance Predictions

### **Orchestration Complexity**
- **Current**: 6-12 agents, simple orchestration
- **Phase 1**: 12-18 agents, moderate complexity (+50%)
- **Phase 2**: 25-35 agents, high complexity (+200%)
- **Mitigation**: Smart loading, context caching, priority routing

### **Resource Impact**
- **Memory**: Linear scaling with agent count
- **Performance**: Logarithmic degradation with smart orchestration
- **Complexity**: Managed through hierarchical agent organization

### **Quality Impact**
- **Positive**: Better domain expertise, more specialized knowledge
- **Risk**: Coordination overhead, potential conflicts
- **Mitigation**: Clear agent boundaries, explicit collaboration patterns
